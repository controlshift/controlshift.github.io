# INTRODUCTION

ChangeSprout Inc., a benefit organization based in New York, provides digital advocacy tools to progressive organizations around the world. 

In 2024, we continued to support the ControlShift distributed organizing platform. ControlShift is used by progressive organizations to support supporter-led petitions, events, and local groups.

As we enter 2025, this report allows us to reflect on the past year, measure the impact we've had, and make a plan for the coming year.


# GENERAL PUBLIC BENEFIT

## Selecting a Third-Party Standard:

As with previous years, we've continued to use B Lab's B Impact Assessment as our third-party standard. B Lab remains a leader in the benefit corporation space and continuing to use their assessments allows us to easily measure impact over time.


## Pursuit of the General Public Benefit and the Extent the General Public Benefit was Created:

At the time of our incorporation, ChangeSprout decided to pursue a general public benefit, which is defined as a "material positive impact on society and the environment." As a software provider, we work to provide this positive impact primarily through our ControlShift product.

ControlShift is a distributed organizing platform. Our tools are built on the idea that people should drive movements, even when they happen online. Organizations use ControlShift to empower their supporters to work for progressive changes in their communities. We believe that regular people becoming leaders make our partners' work more authentic, agile, and robust.

Below is a selection of campaigns that were powered by ControlShift in 2024.


### General Public Benefit:

In Australia, the Victorian Trades Hall Council and the Migrant Workers Centre had a big win for worker protections. Due to their campaigning, the Australian government introduced a workplace justice visa. This visa allows migrant workers who file a complaint against their employer to remain in the country for 12 months during legal actions and maintain full work rights during that period.

Also in Australia, teaching students are required to complete up to 80 days of practicum placements. These placements were unpaid, which made it difficult for students with financial responsibilities. Thanks to the Victorian Trades Hall Council, the Australian Education Union, and almost 14,000 Megaphone supporters, the practicum placements will now be paid.

In Hungary, aHang members learned that two state-funded schools would be privatized with very short notice, requiring parents to pay tuition for their children to attend. This included one of the top-rated schools in the country. Then more than 12,000 aHang members jumped into action – they prevented the last minute change and ensured that the schools remained state-funded and free for parents and students.

Also in Hungary, the government announced that soldiers would be used to fill teaching positions, even if they have no teacher qualifications. More than 16,000 aHang members, recognizing the importance of education and the need for qualified educators, came together to protest the proposal and the government backed down.

In Ireland, an investigation by RTÉ uncovered abusive behavior at a horse abattoir in Kildare. Uplift members jumped into action, with more than 35,000 people successfully calling for the Minister of Agriculture to shutter the facility.

In the Netherlands, 13,000 DeGoedeZaak supporters signed a petition in support of the "Bed Bad Brood" ("Bed Bath Bread") program in Rotterdam which provides housing, food, and opportunities for undocumented residents. The program had been on the government's chopping block, with 45 residents to lose access to housing and support on 1 January. The DeGoedeZaak petition made support for the program clear and the program will continue.

In New Zealand, stalking is not a crime. ActionStation members, together with the Coalition for the Safety of Women and Children, organized more than 20,000 supporters to pressure the Minister of Justice to make anti-stalking legislation a priority. Months later, the new legislation has been introduced and passed its first reading.

In Romania, the Vrancea County Students' Council created a campaign because multiple schools had no heat amidst falling temperatures in November. By successfully calling attention to the issue and rallying the support of more than 1,000 Declic signers, the students were able to get the heating debts paid, the heat turned on for most of the schools, and classes moved online for the non-heated school.

In South Africa backlogs led to long delays for graduates waiting to receive diplomas and certifications needed to secure employment. Amandla.mobi members came together to draw attention to the issue and diplomas have begun flowing again.

In Sweden, Skiftet members came together to prevent the proposed closure of a local preschool.

In Switzerland, more than 17,000 Campax supporters demanded and won an increase in funding for the Women's European Championship 2025. The tournament is a flagship project for Swiss football and the increased funding demonstrates commitment to women's sport.

In the UK, the Trades Union Congress and GMB secured wins for Tetley Tea workers, including a backdated 5% pay increase, a 5% pay increase for the coming year, and additional days of leave.

Also, in the UK the Trades Union Congress, Unite the Union, and more than 5,000 Megaphone supporters campaigned to increase caterer pay at the Drax power station. They won and secured the equivalent of a 19% pay increase.

In the US, San Diego flooding displaced more than 900 households. An emergency housing voucher program was set to expire when MoveOn members jumped into action. Pressure from supporters led to the board of supervisors committing an additional $9.6 million in food and housing vouchers for flood victims.


### Environment:
In addition to campaigns on other progressive topics, customers also ran various campaigns focused on environmental protections. Some of the campaigns in 2024 included:

350.org Canada ran a large campaign in support of a universal, free heat pump program. The campaign will continue in 2025, and the 350.org team has already won the support of numerous Members of Parliament from multiple parties.

In Romania, Declic signers successfully squashed a proposal to limit the number of PHEV chargers in the Suceava municipality.

In the UK, 38 Degrees and the Coal Action Network partnered to block the establishment of a new deep coal mine in Cumbria. After four years of campaigning and more than 115,000 38 Degrees members coming together in opposition, the UK government announced that it would keep to its commitments under the Climate Change Act 2008 and withdraw its plans for the new coal mine.

## DISCUSSION AND PLANS FOR IMPROVEMENTS

### Governance:

In 2024 our governance score decreased slightly though our governance structure and mission have not changed. Increasing our score in this section would require legal changes, like changing our corporate structure, which we will not be making in the coming year.


### Workers:

In the past year, our workers score increased. As with previous years, our score in this category is due to our commitment to providing generous benefits packages, livable wages, and other benefits for our employees. In the next year, we'll aim to increase our professional development programs for employees.


### Community:

In 2024 our community score decreased slightly. As a fully remote company, our community is not restricted to a specific local area, so major improvements to this score are unlikely in the coming year.


### Customers:

In the past year our customers score decreased but remains a high performing category. ChangeSprout's goal is to work closely with our customers to ensure that we're building the tools they need to support their important work. We remain committed to treating customer data with the care it requires; soliciting feedback from customers about the development of new features within our tools; and providing reduced fees, or pro-bono access, to growing organizations and organizations operating in the majority world.


### Environment:

In 2024, our environment score increased. As a fully remote team without corporate office space, we're unable to measure energy and water usage or set reduction targets in the way that many of the questions in this section assume. We do however estimate our servers' energy usage and attempt to offset that usage via renewable energy credits.


### General Reflections:

Our scores changed in 2024, but our commitment to providing impactful tools to our customers while also being good stewards to our employees remains unchanged.
